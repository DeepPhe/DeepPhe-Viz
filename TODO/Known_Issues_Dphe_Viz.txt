Priority Tasks

- Refactor test data:
    - I need to fix the line_divider ✅
    - if both relations are On and they have the same date, then I will just use one vertical line ✅
    - fix the bottom part, there is too much space in there
    - get onClick working
    - figure out the random line that is "Overlap" to "Overlap" and why the line thickness is half regular size


Sub-Tasks:
- look into circle, not fully returning to normal after unclick mention

Desirable:
- Option to expand a lane to take up the whole graph for better view
- option to flip between relation events for a document or the whole patient
- look to add clickability in document, i.e. click 'right' in documentView and 'right' in conceptList will highlight
- date anchor points

Issues/Bugs:
- Sometimes when clicking the concepts below in the document, the last one does not unclick
- 'Unknown' semantic group is not showing up in concept list correctly
