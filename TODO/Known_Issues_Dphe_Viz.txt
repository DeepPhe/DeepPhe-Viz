Priority Tasks
- Event relation timeline needs working zoom ✅
- Patient episode timeline needs x-axis adjusted to move with zoom ✅
- Implement forward and backward clicking between Event Timeline Component and Document and episode timeline component ✅
- Check for bugs and unclear actions

Sub-Tasks:
- move collapse arrows to left ✅
- move label back to center ✅
- move arrow and component label to left ✅
- add more to overview (month/year) ✅
- add hover definitions to labels (see below) ✅
- make vertical contains lines, 3/4 of og size as well as the arrows ✅
- make hover definition on the labels and get rid of the I symbol ✅
- ConceptList and ER Timeline don't match up on clicks (for lines, not arrows) ✅
- look into circle, not fully returning to normal after unclick mention 
- hover anchor points
- debug report_type_divider ✅
- get rid of last report_type_divider on PE Timeline ✅













Desirable:
- Option to expand a lane to take up the whole graph for better view
- option to flip between relation events for a document or the whole patient
- look to add clickability in document, i.e. click 'right' in documentView and 'right' in conceptList will highlight
- date anchor points

Dphe meeting:
4/24/25
- hover to give more info on y-axis names ✅
- try to show better connection between clicked mention and note ✅
- look to make changes to name 'severity' and 'finding'

Issues/Bugs:
- fix width of PatientTimeline (The overview is spilling off to the right and left, as well as the main) ✅
- fix width of Event Relation Timeline zoom. ✅
- rect needs to follow along ✅
- Sometimes when clicking the concepts below in the document, the last one does not unclick
- 'Unknown' semantic group is not showing up in concept list correctly



Logic:

- if a relation is clicked and is not in clickedTerms
    - it should be in clickedTerms
    - it should be selected

- if a relation is clicked and is already in clickedTerms
    - it should be removed from clickedTerms
    - it should be unselected
