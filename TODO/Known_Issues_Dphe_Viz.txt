Let's do a prio list:

- Organize the new data given in the tsv ✅
- find another way to highlight the document in the PET (patient episode TImeline) ✅
- fix mention highlight in doc viewer ✅
- if the doc in the PET is clicked again, the mention_id that is associated with the Temporal Event should be highlighted on the doc and mention list ✅
- get dots working on overview ✅
- Create mock dates and relations for patient concepts in anticipation of real data being available.  (10 per group) ✅
- FilteredConcepts has 83 concepts. We want to get every ID from this list and add it to unsum_output.tsv ✅
- Change 'Episode' to 'Document Episode Type:' ✅
- chagne time relation to Event occurrence in patient Timeline ✅
- get rid of overview label names (include date inline with months of overview) ✅
- Zoom bug fix
- expand and collapse of all components ✅
- Implement forward and backward clicking between Event Timeline Component and Document and episode timeline component 



SubTasks:
- P_E x-axis fix for zoom

easy:
- figure out where the right arrow contains is in the data and fix that ✅
- change colors to green, negated is red ✅
- change overlap back to middle line of normal width ✅
- change patient notes to be darker color of itself when selected (the color we are looking for is the same color it is when hovered)

medium:
- make both svg timelines web responsive ✅
- Work on Zoom for bottom timeline
- Implement forward and backward clicking between Event Timeline Component, Documents, and Episode Timeline Component
- date anchor points

hard:
- Option to expand a lane to take up the whole graph for better view
- option to flip between relation events for a document or the whole patient


- add more to overview (month/year)
- get rid of ticks underneath main view
- get rid of points in overview ✅
- change tLink to Time Relation ✅
- change data points from just 10
- comment out site and qual ✅
- revisit collision to account for size of mention on timeline


Dphe meeting: 
- look to make changes to name 'severity' and 'finding'
- hover to give more info on y-axis names

- try to show better connection between clicked mention and note
- 



What can the user see when hovering label of event mention:
- definition in way of examples 
- Finding (symptoms, test results)
- Severity (stage, grade, tnm)
- Disease (neoplasm, disease, disorder)
- Treatment (procedure, medication) 


- before ( Event occurs *before* time/date)
- after ( Event occurs *after* time/date)
- within (Event occurs *within* time span)
- overlap (Event overlaps time span)






Issue List:

- If I click one temporal symbol that has the note_name = 'doc1_note10' and I click another temporal symbol with the same note_name. Then the
red circle around it will disappear. It should probably stay in that case, need to figure out best course of action.
 (Going with, i'm getting rid of the option to click again and get rid of the red circle) ✅

- Docviewer is not updating correctly when already open and different doc is clicked in timeline ✅

- first load is not highlighting ✅

- fix width of PatientTimeline (The overview is spilling off to the right and left, as well as the main)

- 'Unknown' semantic group is not showing up in concept list correctly


Side Quests:

- left margin for both timelines need to match up ✅
- look to close things in together ✅
- change tlink to something else 
- font size smaller on y-axis
- fix overwritten y-xis fonts ✅
