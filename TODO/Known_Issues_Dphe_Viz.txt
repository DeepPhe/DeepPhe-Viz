    - I need to fix the line_divider, maybe use the report_type_label
    - fix the bottom part, there is too much space in there
    - look to change the relation1 and relation 2 to work
    - also have to see if i need to add a line between two start and end date if it is a on and on


Sub-Tasks:
- look into circle, not fully returning to normal after unclick mention

Desirable:
- Option to expand a lane to take up the whole graph for better view
- option to flip between relation events for a document or the whole patient
- look to add clickability in document, i.e. click 'right' in documentView and 'right' in conceptList will highlight
- date anchor points
