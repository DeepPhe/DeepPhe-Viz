Priority Tasks
- Refactor test data:
    - change how the data is parsed
    - need to find a way to get note_id from click, maybe we get it from conceptID somehow
    - NoteID is in conceptsPerDocument, we can look for the noteID this way by connecting it with conceptID




Questions
- no more chemo_text in data, meaning do we need to get that
from somewhere so there is still lanes?



Sub-Tasks:
- move collapse arrows to left ✅
- move label back to center ✅
- move arrow and component label to left ✅
- add more to overview (month/year) ✅
- add hover definitions to labels (see below) ✅
- make vertical contains lines, 3/4 of og size as well as the arrows ✅
- make hover definition on the labels and get rid of the I symbol ✅
- ConceptList and ER Timeline don't match up on clicks (for lines, not arrows) ✅
- look into circle, not fully returning to normal after unclick mention
- debug report_type_divider ✅
- get rid of last report_type_divider on PE Timeline ✅
- change loading... to nothing or 'click timeline to view doc' ✅



Desirable:
- Option to expand a lane to take up the whole graph for better view
- option to flip between relation events for a document or the whole patient
- look to add clickability in document, i.e. click 'right' in documentView and 'right' in conceptList will highlight
- date anchor points

Dphe meeting:
4/24/25
- hover to give more info on y-axis names ✅
- try to show better connection between clicked mention and note ✅
- look to make changes to name 'severity' and 'finding'

Issues/Bugs:
- fix width of PatientTimeline (The overview is spilling off to the right and left, as well as the main) ✅
- fix width of Event Relation Timeline zoom. ✅
- rect needs to follow along ✅
- Sometimes when clicking the concepts below in the document, the last one does not unclick
- 'Unknown' semantic group is not showing up in concept list correctly
