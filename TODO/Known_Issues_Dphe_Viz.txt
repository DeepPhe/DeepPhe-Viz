Priority Tasks

- Refactor test data:
    - change how the data is parsed
    - need to find a way to get note_id from click, maybe we get it from conceptID somehow
    - NoteID is in conceptsPerDocument, we can look for the noteID this way by connecting it with conceptID

Sub-Tasks:
- look into circle, not fully returning to normal after unclick mention

Desirable:
- Option to expand a lane to take up the whole graph for better view
- option to flip between relation events for a document or the whole patient
- look to add clickability in document, i.e. click 'right' in documentView and 'right' in conceptList will highlight
- date anchor points

Dphe meeting:
4/24/25
- look to make changes to name 'severity' and 'finding'
6/26/25

Issues/Bugs:
- Sometimes when clicking the concepts below in the document, the last one does not unclick
- 'Unknown' semantic group is not showing up in concept list correctly
