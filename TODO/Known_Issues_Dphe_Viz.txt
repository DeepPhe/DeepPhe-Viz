Priority Tasks
- Event relation timeline needs working zoom ✅
- Patient episode timeline needs x-axis adjusted to move with zoom ✅
- Implement forward and backward clicking between Event Timeline Component
and Document and episode timeline component

Sub-Tasks:
- date anchor points
- move collapse arrows to left ✅
- move label back to center ✅
- Option to expand a lane to take up the whole graph for better view
- option to flip between relation events for a document or the whole patient
- add more to overview (month/year) ✅
- revisit collision to account for size of mention on timeline
- add hover definitions to labels (see below)


Dphe meeting: 
- look to make changes to name 'severity' and 'finding'
- hover to give more info on y-axis names
- try to show better connection between clicked mention and note

What can the user see when hovering label of event mention:
- definition in way of examples 
- Finding (symptoms, test results)
- Severity (stage, grade, tnm)
- Disease (neoplasm, disease, disorder)
- Treatment (procedure, medication)
- before ( Event occurs *before* time/date)
- after ( Event occurs *after* time/date)
- within (Event occurs *within* time span)
- overlap (Event overlaps time span)

Issues/Bugs:
- fix width of PatientTimeline (The overview is spilling off to the right and left, as well as the main) ✅
- fix width of Event Relation Timeline zoom. ✅
- rect needs to follow along ✅
- 'Unknown' semantic group is not showing up in concept list correctly
