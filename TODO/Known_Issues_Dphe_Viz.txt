Priority Tasks

- Refactor test data:
    - I need to fix the line_divider ✅
    - if both relations are On and they have the same date, then I will just use one vertical line ✅
    - fix the bottom part, there is too much space in there ✅
    - clean up top legend ✅
    - look into adding an x-axis on top as well ✅
    - less padding between relations vertically ✅
    - change divider lines to solid ✅
    - Sort conceptId by occurrence ✅
    - also need to make a horizontal marker to represent overlap ✅
    - make arrows smaller ✅
    - change overlap so it goes longer than dates given ✅
    - finding, disease, severity, treatment
    - hover over relation timeline: Concept, first relation, second relation
    - get onClick working
    - figure out the random line that is "Overlap" to "Overlap" and why the line thickness is half regular size


        - list of ctakes-dockers and ctakes-example etc
       - maintenence, documentation, official contributer

Sub-Tasks:
- look into circle, not fully returning to normal after unclick mention

Desirable:
- Option to expand a lane to take up the whole graph for better view
- option to flip between relation events for a document or the whole patient
- look to add clickability in document, i.e. click 'right' in documentView and 'right' in conceptList will highlight
- date anchor points
- relations that are exactly the same start and end date could be combined and shown in hover

Issues/Bugs:
- Sometimes when clicking the concepts below in the document, the last one does not unclick
- 'Unknown' semantic group is not showing up in concept list correctly
